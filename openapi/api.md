# Explanation of Reminder API2 OpenAPI Specification

## 1. OpenAPI Version Declaration
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
```
This line specifies that we're using version 3.0.0 of the OpenAPI Specification. It's crucial for tools and parsers to understand how to interpret the rest of the document.

## 2. API Metadata
```yaml
info:
  title: Reminder API2
  version: 1.0.0
```
The `info` section provides metadata about the API:
- `title`: The name of the API
- `version`: The version of the API (not to be confused with the OpenAPI version)

## 3. Servers
```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://439580bc-fb9d-4afc-b21e-2db56160930a.mock.pstmn.io
```
This section defines the server(s) on which the API is hosted. In this case, it's pointing to a mock server, likely for testing purposes.

## 4. Paths
The `paths` section defines the endpoints of your API and the operations available on those endpoints.

### 4.1 GET /reminders
```yaml
/reminders:
  get:
    summary: List all reminders
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Successful response
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Reminder'
```
This defines a GET operation on the `/reminders` endpoint:
- `summary`: A brief description of what the operation does
- `responses`: Describes possible responses
  - `200`: Indicates a successful response
    - `content`: Specifies the response format (JSON in this case)
    - `schema`: Defines the structure of the response (an array of Reminder objects)

### 4.2 POST /reminders
```yaml
  post:
    summary: Create a new reminder
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/NewReminder'
    responses:
      '201':
        description: Created
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Reminder'
```
This defines a POST operation on the same `/reminders` endpoint:
- `requestBody`: Describes the expected request payload
  - `schema`: References the `NewReminder` schema for the request body structure
- `responses`: Describes the possible response (201 Created)
  - The response body is defined using the `Reminder` schema

## 5. Components
The `components` section is used to define reusable schemas.

### 5.1 NewReminder Schema
```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    NewReminder:
      type: object
      required:
        - title
        - dueDate
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
        dueDate:
          type: string
          format: date-time
```
This defines the structure for creating a new reminder:
- `required`: Lists the mandatory fields
- `properties`: Defines each field of the reminder

### 5.2 Reminder Schema
```yaml
    Reminder:
      allOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/NewReminder'
        - type: object
          required:
            - id
          properties:
            id:
              type: string
              format: uuid
```
This schema extends `NewReminder` and adds an `id` field:
- `allOf`: Combines multiple schemas
- It includes all properties from `NewReminder` and adds the `id` field

## Key Concepts
1. **Schema References**: `$ref` is used to reference schemas defined in the `components` section, promoting reusability.
2. **Response Structures**: The API clearly defines what to expect in successful responses.
3. **Data Types**: The specification uses common data types like `string` and specific formats like `date-time` and `uuid`.
4. **Required Fields**: The `required` arrays specify which fields are mandatory in requests and responses.

This OpenAPI specification provides a clear, machine-readable description of the Reminder API2, detailing its endpoints, operations, request/response structures, and data models.
